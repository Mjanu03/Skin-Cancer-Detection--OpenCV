# Skin-Cancer-Detection--OpenCV
Developed an AI-based skin cancer detection system using OpenCV, Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. Applied CNNs and transfer learning with ResNet and VGG16 for classifying lesions. Preprocessed ISIC images with segmentation and noise reduction, achieving high accuracy in benign vs malignant detection.
